//! An alternate algorithm to DSRN's own: a flat, size-ordered greedy
//! tile placement, with no region tree at all.
//!
//! DSRN decides a region's whole subtree at once, comparing the exact
//! cost of every way it could go before committing to any of it. This
//! is the opposite kind of pass: there are no regions, no standing, no
//! recursive cost tables. There is a plane and a size, biggest first,
//! and one rule at each size: a tile that is one thing, or that holds
//! the same cells as a same-size neighbour, gets placed and claimed; a
//! tile that is neither is left for the next, finer size to try on its
//! own four quarters. Both checks read the bitmap directly and answer
//! at once -- the bitmap never changes, so there is nothing for either
//! one to wait on, whatever order tiles get visited in. Tiles never
//! overlap, so a size that has already claimed a tile is a size no
//! finer pass ever has to look at again, and by the time the pass
//! reaches 1x1 every remaining cell is, on its own, one thing -- so
//! the pass always finishes and always covers the whole bitmap.
//!
//! This file only decides which tiles that rule would place. It does
//! not write a bitstream: there is nothing here yet that says how a
//! tile's own size, position and kind (bound to a value, or copying a
//! direction) would be spelled out in bits, only how many of each
//! kind there would be. That is the thing worth counting first,
//! against what the region-based encoder actually produces, before
//! anything is spent on a grammar for it.
